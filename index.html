        <h1>Fast&Furious - Daily Commute</h1>
        <p>
          It's 7am, the alarm goes off for you to get up and go to work. But you
          are so tired that you hit the snooze button and thought that if you
          rest your eyes for just 5 minutes you would feel better. You wake up
          and it's now 7:50 am, and now you have to get to work in just 10
          minutes or your boss will fired you!
